I. Study chapters regarding scheduling

II. Examine modern os scheduling simulator. Read the user guide. Answer the questions.

III. Implement **SHORTEST REMAINING TIME FIRST** algorithm.

IV. Introduce parameters required by the scheduling algorithm. Extend the process model to address gaps in the original system and to accommodate specific algorithm. Add more parameters to the system if necessary.

V. Improve (refactor/reengineer) simulator.
